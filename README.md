# Controls
WASD for moving camera.

You can select a building with clicking on the buildings icon in the production menu.  
Selected building will follow your mouse you can left click to place the building or esc button to cancel placing.  

Some buildings can produce soldiers and other productions.  
You can select the soldiers with left mouse button and see that they have a blue aura that shows that they are selected.  
Selected soldiers can receive orders by right mouse button for moving or attacking.

# TODO
